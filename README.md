## 3. Project Details
The application contains three types of routes: one for service, another for the kitchen, and another for the administrator.

To log in and access any of the routes, click on https://plant-burguer.vercel.app and log in with the credentials below:

| USER                         |PASSWORD|
|------------------------------|:----:|
| atendimento@plantburguer.com | 123456 |
| cozinha@plantburguer.com     | 123456 |
| admin@plantburguer.com       | 123456 |


### Service

In the service route, the waiter/waitress can place a new order and also access orders that are ready to be served. Upon accessing the "New Order" route, the attendant enters the customer's name and is then redirected to the menu. By selecting the desired items from the menu, they are automatically added to the order summary. After finalizing the order and clicking "Send," the orders are immediately forwarded to the kitchen.

In the "Orders to Serve" route, the attendant has access to the orders coming from the kitchen that are ready to be served. Once delivered, the orders can be marked as completed and viewed in the "Delivered Orders" route.


### Kitchen
In the kitchen route, the cook receives the orders that come from service. After finishing the order and clicking "Ready," the order is sent to the "Orders to Serve" route in the service section. Additionally, in the "Completed" tab, the cook will be able to see the orders that have been completed and how long the preparation took.


### Administrator
In this route, it is possible to view, register, edit, and delete products and employees.
